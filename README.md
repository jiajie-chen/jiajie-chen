### `Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ðŸŒŽ`

Hi! I'm **JJ (Jiajie) Chen**, a professional data engineer with an interest in AI/ML, distributed system architecture, and scientific computing.
As a hobbyist programmer, I like to work on frontend webpage design and game design.

I use Debian and deriviatives at home, but I'm also experimenting with Fedora Silverblue.
At work, I use macOS (M1) with Docker images in Alpine and Debian/Ubuntu.

I mainly develop in:
- Python
- Typescript
- Bash

I'm currently learning more about:
- C++17 and Rust, to get better at modern systems programming
- Homelab setups, to get better at managing tech stacks from the bottom up

I'm currently working on:
- [JSON Resume themes](https://github.com/jiajie-chen/jsonresume-theme-coldbrew)
- [Astro SSGs](https://github.com/jiajie-chen/jiajie-chen.github.io)
- [C++ game design](https://github.com/jiajie-chen/raylib-game)
