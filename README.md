### `Hello World! 👋🌎`

Hi! I'm **JJ (Jiajie) Chen**, a professional software engineer.
As a hobbyist programmer, I dabble in systems programming, homelabbing, and FLOSS.

I'm currently learning more about:
- C++17 and Rust, to get better at modern systems programming
- IaaC setups, to get better at managing tech stacks from the bottom up

I'm currently working on:
- [A custom bootc Linux derivative](https://github.com/jiajie-chen/bluefin-tiling)
